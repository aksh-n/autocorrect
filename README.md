# autocorrect
Autocorrection, also known as autocorrect, refers to the process through which the computer automatically recognizes an incorrectly spelled or mistyped word (e.g. "mispelled") and replaces it with the correct spelling ("misspelled"), usually as soon as the user finishes typing the current word/phrase. This project aims to develop this feature.
